                <h3>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for creating and structuring content for the web. Some of the main uses of HTML include:</h3>
                <li>Creating the structure of a webpage: HTML is used to define the basic structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and other content elements.</li>
                <li>Formatting text and other content: HTML is used to format text and other content elements using styles, such as font size, color, and alignment.

                <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation and styling of web content. It is used in conjunction with HTML to provide a wide range of design and layout options for webpages. Some of the main reasons why CSS is used include:</h3>

                <li>Separation of content and presentation: CSS allows you to separate the content and structure of a webpage from its presentation and styling, making it easier to maintain and update the website in the long run.</li>
                <li>Consistency and flexibility: CSS allows you to define consistent styles and layouts for multiple webpages on a website, providing a unified and professional look and feel. It also allows for flexibility in changing the presentation of the website, without affecting the underlying content and structure</li>
                <li>Design and layout options: CSS provides a wide range of design and layout options, including font styles, colors, backgrounds, margins, borders, and more, allowing for greater creativity and customization in webpage design.</li>

                <li>Search engine optimization: CSS can be used to structure and optimize web content for search engines, helping to improve the website's visibility and ranking in search results.</li>

            <ul>
                <h3>JavaScript is used as a client-side scripting language on the web to enhance the functionality and interactivity of webpages. Some of the main reasons why JavaScript is used include:  </h3>
                <li>Dynamic content: JavaScript allows you to create dynamic and interactive web content that can be updated and modified in real-time based on user actions, making the website more engaging and responsive.</li>
                <li>Webpage behavior: JavaScript can be used to control the behavior of webpages, such as validating user inputs in web forms, displaying alerts or pop-ups, and creating interactive animations and effects</li>
                <li>User interface enhancements: JavaScript can be used to enhance the user interface of webpages, such as creating drop-down menus, sliders, and other interactive widgets that make it easier for users to navigate and interact with the website</li>
                <li>Web application development: JavaScript can be used to develop complex web applications, such as games, social media platforms, and e-commerce websites, that require advanced client-side functionalit</li>
                <li>Cross-platform compatibility: JavaScript can be executed on any device with a web browser, making it a versatile and widely used language for web development.</li>
